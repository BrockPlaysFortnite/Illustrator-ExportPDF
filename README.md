# Illustrator-ExportPDF
This script will save your current open Illustrator file as a PDF on the desktop. 
If the PDF already exists it will add a number so that the original file is not overwritten.
Each time it is run it will increment the number so you can make as many copies as you need.

Example:
testfile.ai

will save as:
testfile.pdf
testfile (1).pdf
testfile (2).pdf
testfile (3).pdf

and so on...
